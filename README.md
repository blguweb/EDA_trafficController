EDA homework: Subject content:traffic controller
Design an intersection traffic control system. In addition to the red, yellow and green indicator lights indicating whether traffic in the east, west, south and north directions is allowed, there is also a clock in countdown mode to display the allowable time for each road in green, yellow and red. The duration of the bulb is 40 and 5 and 45 seconds. When any one of the east-west highway or the north-south highway has special circumstances, such as fire trucks and police cars to perform tasks, the traffic police should manually control the traffic control system to immediately enter the special operating state. Status, that is, all vehicles on the two roads will stop the pass, all the red indicator lights will light up, the clock will stop, and its number will flash. When the special operating state ends, the management system will be restored to its original state and continue normal operation.
